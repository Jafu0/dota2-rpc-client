## Running on Linux (Experimental)

Just as a warning it's just a experimental version. If you find any bugs in this version, please report them. The Discord API and other functions commonly used on Windows may not have the same effect on Linux.

Unfortunately, this service has not been adapted to work with `daemon`. So installing and running the application must be done manually from the terminal.

Use this command to install
```shell
./dota2-rpc-client -i
```

And run the application using

```shell
./dota2-rpc-client
```
## Settings

You can choose what can be displayed and other application settings.

Just modify the [config.json](src/templates/config/config.json) file.

```json
{
    "HOST": "127.0.0.1",
    "PORT" : 52424,
    "LOCALE" : "System",
    "DISPLAY_OPTIONS":
    {
        "AEGIS" : true,
        "AGHANIM" : true,
        "GOLD_AND_LAST_HIT": true,
        "KILL_DEATH_ASSIST" : true,
        "SMOKE": true
    },
    "STEAM_FOLDER": ""
}
```

## Compilation Instructions

Want to improve the project or compile a version outside the official channel?

> See the [Contribution Section](#contribution) to read more instructions or clone this repository.

This project mainly uses 4 libraries to work. Are they:

 * [Discord SDK](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) - A Library for Integration with the Discord application;
 * [Drogon C++](https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon) - A web framework written with C++;
 * [SrvLib](https://github.com/Tomenz/SrvLib) - A library for creating services in Windows and Linux created by [@tomenz](https://github.com/tomenz).
 * [NFD](https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended) - A small C library with that portably invokes native file open, folder select and file save dialogs.  Created by [@btzy](https://github.com/btzy) and [@mlabbe](https://github.com/mlabbe).

This is a project made with *CMake*, these libraries are downloaded during the first compilation of the software and placed in a folder called `third_party`.

With the repository downloaded, run the command:

```shell
 cmake --build {folder} --config Debug --target dota2-rpc-client -j {threads}
```
 
> If you choose not to use automatic compilation and want to download libraries on your own, you can use the `vcpkg` to install the *Discord SDK* and the *Drogon C++*.
> 
> An installation guide for the *Drogon C++* dependencies can be found on [this page](https://drogon.docsforge.com/master/installation/).

## Web Page Compilation Instructions

Would you like to change the project webpage? You can access the files from the `web` directory.

The following frameworks and templates were used:

 * [Angular 13](https://angular.io/) - A component-based framework for building scalable web applications;
 * [Paradigm Shift](https://html5up.net/paradigm-shift) - A open-source web template created by [@ajlkn](https://github.com/ajlkn)

Instead of using static pages, a framework was used to create the site. So to compile, follow the instructions [available here](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local).

With everything configured, use the command below to run:

```shell
 ng serve
```
