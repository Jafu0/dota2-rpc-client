This project mainly uses 3 libraries to work. Are they:

 * [Discord SDK](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) - A Library for Integration with the Discord application;
 * [Drogon C++](https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon) - A web framework written with C++;
 * [SrvLib](https://github.com/Tomenz/SrvLib) - A library for creating services in Windows and Linux.

This is a project made with *CMake*, these libraries are downloaded during the first compilation of the software and placed in a folder called `third_party`.

With the repository downloaded, run the command:

```shell
 cmake --build {folder} --config Debug --target dota2-rpc-client -j {threads}
```
 
> If you choose not to use automatic compilation and want to download libraries on your own, you can use the `vcpkg` to install the *Discord SDK* and the *Drogon C++*.
> 
> An installation guide for the *Drogon C++* dependencies can be found on [this page](https://drogon.docsforge.com/master/installation/).
